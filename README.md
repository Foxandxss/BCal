# BCal - Menstruation Calendar

BCal is an menstruation calendar made with Angular.JS

BCal is a backend-less application which uses LocalStorage to store our configuration.

Try it here: [BCal](http://bcal.foxandxss.net)

**TODO**:

+ Localization
+ e2e tests with protractor
+ Improve my tests? (First time :))
+ Clean up the Less to be more... Less
+ Maybe some responsive design (Heh, that will be hard due my CSS skills)
+ Check store2 to replace LocalStorageModule

Please, fill any issue or send a PR if you get something interesting (or maybe something of my TODO's list :)).

The goal of this app was for educational purposes.
